//! `tender skill {print, install, path}` — manage the embedded agent skill stub.
//!
//! The stub's single source of truth is `src/embedded/SKILL.md`, embedded at
//! build time. `install` lands it as a Claude Code skill file so an agent picks
//! up the bootstrap rules; the command is idempotent when the on-disk copy
//! already matches and refuses to clobber a user-edited file without `--force`.
//! `path` reports where install would write, with no filesystem side effects.
